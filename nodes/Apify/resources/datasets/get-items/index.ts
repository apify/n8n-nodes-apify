    'Returns data stored in the dataset in a desired format  Response format The format of the response depends on format query parameter  The format parameter can have one of the following values  json  jsonl  xml  html  csv  xlsx and rss  The following table describes how each format is treated  Note that CSV  XLSX and HTML tables are limited to 500 columns and the column names cannot be longer than 200 characters  JSON  XML and RSS formats do not have such restrictions  Hidden fields The top level fields starting with the   character are considered hidden  These are useful to store debugging information and can be omitted from the output by providing the skipHidden 1 or clean 1 query parameters  For example  if you store the following object to the dataset    productName   iPhone Xs   description   Welcome to the big screens    debug    url   https   www apple com lae iphone xs    crawledAt   2019 01 21T16 06 03 683Z      The  debug field will be considered as hidden and can be omitted from the results  This is useful to provide nice cleaned data to end users  while keeping debugging info available if needed  The Dataset object returned by the API contains the number of such clean items in thedataset cleanItemCount property  XML format extension When exporting results to XML or RSS formats  the names of object properties become XML tags and the corresponding values become tag s children  For example  the following JavaScript object    name   Paul Newman   address      type   home   street   21st   city   Chicago       type   office   street  null  city  null       will be transformed to the following XML snippet   name Paul Newman  name   address   type home  type   street 21st  street   city Chicago  city    address   address   type office  type   street    city     address  If the JavaScript object contains a property named   then its sub properties are exported as attributes of the parent XML element  If the parent XML element does not have any child elements then its value is taken from a JavaScript object property named    For example  the following JavaScript object     address              type    home      street    21st    city    Chicago               type    office           unknown       will be transformed to the following XML snippet   address type  home    street 21st  street   city Chicago  city    address   address type  office  unknown  address  This feature is also useful to customize your RSS feeds generated for various websites  By default the whole result is wrapped in a  items  element and each page object is wrapped in a  item  element  You can change this using xmlRoot and xmlRow url parameters  Pagination The generated response supports pagination  The pagination is always performed with the granularity of a single item  regardless whether unwind parameter was provided  By default  the Items in the response are sorted by the time they were stored to the database  therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch the items as they are being added  The maximum number of items that will be returned in a single API call is limited to 250 000  If you specify desc 1 query parameter  the results are returned in the reverse order than they were stored  i e  from newest to oldest items   Note that only the order of Items is reversed  but not the order of the unwind array elements',
